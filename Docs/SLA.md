# Service Level Tiers (Reference)

These tiers describe response and support expectations for MSMP under different engagement levels. They are informational unless incorporated into a separately executed written agreement.

## Scope
- Applies to support of MSMP (including `devpacks-cli.exe`, optional local UI components, and vendor-provided Docker images).
- Software runs locally; no hosted service uptime is offered. SLAs cover support responsiveness, not platform availability.

## General Notes
- SLAs are not active unless covered by a signed agreement.
- Local/offline architecture means uptime commitments are out of scope; SLAs address support responsiveness and defect handling only.
- Customer is responsible for backups, change control, and validation in their environment.

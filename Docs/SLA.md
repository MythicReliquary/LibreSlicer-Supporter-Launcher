# Service Level Tiers (Reference)

These tiers describe response and support expectations for Dev_Packs under different engagement levels. They are informational unless incorporated into a separately executed written agreement.

## Scope
- Applies to support of the Dev_Packs CLI, local UI components (if included), and vendor-provided Docker images.
- Software runs locally; no hosted service uptime is offered. SLAs cover support responsiveness, not platform availability.

## Tiers

### 1) Personal (Non-Commercial)
- **Use**: Personal/non-commercial use.
- **Response target**: Best-effort; no guaranteed SLA.
- **Channels**: Email.
- **Patches**: Next planned release; no expedited fixes.

### 2) Indie (Commercial, Small Team)
- **Use**: Commercial use for small teams (e.g., up to 3 seats).
- **Response target**:
  - **P1**: 2 business days
  - **P2**: 3 business days
  - **P3/P4**: 5 business days
- **Channels**: Email during business hours.
- **Patches**: Included in next maintenance release; critical issues triaged for earlier delivery when feasible.

### 3) Studio (Commercial, Team / Production)
- **Use**: Commercial use for teams (e.g., up to 10 seats) with production workflows.
- **Response target**:
  - **P1**: 1 business day
  - **P2**: 2 business days
  - **P3/P4**: 5 business days
- **Channels**: Email; optional scheduled calls by agreement.
- **Patches**: Hotfixes for P1 as mutually agreed; maintenance releases for others.

### 4) Enterprise (By Agreement)
- **Use**: Regulated/large-scale deployments needing heightened assurances.
- **Response target**:
  - **P1**: 4 business hours
  - **P2**: 1 business day
  - **P3/P4**: 3 business days
- **Channels**: Designated contacts and agreed escalation paths (email and/or on-call by agreement).
- **Patches**: Committed timelines per agreement; backports when feasible.

## General Notes
- SLAs are not active unless covered by a signed agreement.
- Local/offline architecture means uptime commitments are out of scope; SLAs address support responsiveness and defect handling only.
- Customer is responsible for backups, change control, and validation in their environment.

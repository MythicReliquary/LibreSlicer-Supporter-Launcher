# End User License Agreement (Evaluation / Trial)

**Effective date:** 2025-12-01  
**Applies to:** Dev_Packs CLI tools, any local UI components included with your bundle (e.g., launcher and/or local UI assets), and any vendor-provided Docker images.

## 1. Acceptance
By running the software, images, or web UI, you agree to this EULA. If you do not agree, do not install or use them.

## 2. License Grant
If you received an evaluation copy from Mythic Reliquary (or an authorized distributor), you are an "Evaluation Recipient".

Mythic Reliquary grants Evaluation Recipients a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to:
- install and use the software locally solely to evaluate whether to purchase or license it; and
- use it for reasonable testing and development experiments related to that evaluation.

No production use, hosting-as-a-service, or resale is permitted without a separate written agreement.

## 3. Evaluation Distribution
Mythic Reliquary (or an authorized distributor) may provide evaluation copies to prospective customers for the purposes of evaluation.

Evaluation Recipients may not redistribute the software, license keys, images, or UI assets to any third party.

## 4. Restrictions
- Do not modify, distribute, sublicense, rent, or host the software for third parties, except as permitted by the open-source licenses referenced below.  
- Do not remove notices or attributions.  
- Keep all processing local; do not route output to external services without authorization.

## 5. Data Handling
- The software is file/CLI-based and designed to run entirely on your machine.  
- You are responsible for safeguarding any input/output files and ensuring they contain no prohibited or third-party confidential data.

## 6. Open-Source Components
- Some third-party/open-source components may be included with the distributed bundle and remain under their respective licenses.
- If there is a conflict between this EULA and an applicable open-source license for a component, the open-source license governs that component.

## 7. No Warranty
The software is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind. Use at your own risk.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from use of the software.

## 9. Updates and Termination
This EULA may change with future releases. Mythic Reliquary may revoke an evaluation license at any time. The license terminates automatically if you breach it; upon termination you must stop using and destroy copies of the software.

## 10. Governing Law
If required by your organization, apply your local law; otherwise no specific jurisdiction is designated.

# End User License Agreement (Evaluation / Trial)

**Effective date:** 2025-12-01  
**Applies to:** MSMP (including `devpacks-cli.exe` and optional local UI components such as `MSMPLauncher.exe`), and any vendor-provided Docker images.

**Informational notice (no change to current terms):**  
> When total sales reach $500,000, MSMP will be rebranded as LibreSlicer prior to publishing the src/ under GNU AGPLv3.

This notice is informational only and does not modify this EULA. No licensing change occurs until that milestone is reached.

## 1. Acceptance
By running the software, images, or web UI, you agree to this EULA. If you do not agree, do not install or use them.

## 2. License Grant
If you received an evaluation copy from Mythic Reliquary (or an authorized distributor), you are an "Evaluation Recipient".

Mythic Reliquary grants Evaluation Recipients a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to:
- install and use the software locally solely to evaluate whether to purchase or license it; and
- use it for reasonable testing and development experiments related to that evaluation.

No production use, hosting-as-a-service, or resale is permitted without a separate written agreement.

## 3. Evaluation Distribution
Mythic Reliquary (or an authorized distributor) may provide evaluation copies to prospective customers for the purposes of evaluation.

Evaluation Recipients may not redistribute the software, license keys, images, or UI assets to any third party.

## 4. Pricing (Informational)
Pricing is informational and may change; your invoice/receipt controls the actual terms and amounts.

- Personal: $49.99 one-time
- Indie: $199.99/year (up to 3 seats)
- Studio: starting at $999/year (Contact Sales)

## 5. Restrictions
- Do not modify, distribute, sublicense, rent, or host the software for third parties, except as permitted by the open-source licenses referenced below.  
- Do not remove notices or attributions.  
- Keep all processing local; do not route output to external services without authorization.

## 6. Data Handling
- The software is file/CLI-based and designed to run entirely on your machine.  
- You are responsible for safeguarding any input/output files and ensuring they contain no prohibited or third-party confidential data.

## 7. Open-Source Components
- Some third-party/open-source components may be included with the MSMP distribution and remain under their respective licenses.
- If there is a conflict between this EULA and an applicable open-source license for a component, the open-source license governs that component.

## 8. No Warranty
The software is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind. Use at your own risk.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from use of the software.

## 10. Updates and Termination
This EULA may change with future releases. Mythic Reliquary may revoke an evaluation license at any time. The license terminates automatically if you breach it; upon termination you must stop using and destroy copies of the software.

## 11. Governing Law
If required by your organization, apply your local law; otherwise no specific jurisdiction is designated.
